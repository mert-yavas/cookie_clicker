# Cookie Clicker
## Overview
Hello, I'm Mert, and today marks Day 48 of my "100 Days of Python" challenge. Welcome to the Cookie Clicker Bot project. In this project, we've developed a Python script that automates the clicking process in the Cookie Clicker game. The script continuously clicks on the cookie element and purchases upgrades from the store based on predefined conditions.

## Project Description
The script uses the Selenium library to interact with the web browser and perform actions on the Cookie Clicker game webpage. It clicks on the cookie element to generate cookies and purchases upgrades from the store to increase cookie production. The goal is to maximize cookie production efficiency in the game.

## How to Run
To use the Cookie Clicker Bot script, follow these steps:

## Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
Install the Selenium library using pip:
```bash
pip install selenium
```
* Download the Chrome WebDriver compatible with your Chrome browser version and place it in the project directory.
* Open the Python script: main.py.
* Customize any parameters or thresholds in the script according to your preferences.
Run the script:
```bash
python main.py
```
* Sit back and watch as the bot automates the cookie clicking process in the game.
